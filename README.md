# Supply Chain Transparency Tracker

An end-to-end supply chain visibility platform that tracks products from raw materials to consumer delivery using blockchain technology. Manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers can verify product authenticity, monitor environmental impact, and ensure ethical sourcing practices. The system provides real-time updates on product location, condition, and custody transfers while maintaining detailed provenance records that combat counterfeit goods and enable rapid recall processes when quality issues arise.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/supply-chain-transparency-tracker.git
   cd supply-chain-transparency-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   clarinet check
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   clarinet test
   ```

4. **Deploy to testnet**
   ```bash

   ```

### Configuration

Update `Clarinet.toml` with your deployment settings:

```toml
[network.testnet]
stacks_node_rpc_address = "https://api.testnet.hiro.so"
bitcoin_node_rpc_address = "https://blockstream.info/testnet/api"

[contracts.product-lifecycle-tracker]
path = "contracts/product-lifecycle-tracker.clar"
clarity_version = 2

[contracts.verification-badge-system]
path = "contracts/verification-badge-system.clar"
clarity_version = 2
```

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Register a New Product
```javascript
const productData = {
  productId: "PROD-001",
  manufacturer: "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM",
  productType: "organic-coffee",
  batchId: "BATCH-2024-001",
  manufacturingDate: 1640995200,
  origin: "Colombia"
};

await contractCall({
  contractAddress: deployerAddress,
  contractName: "product-lifecycle-tracker",
  functionName: "register-product",
  functionArgs: [
    stringCV(productData.productId),
    principalCV(productData.manufacturer),
    stringCV(productData.productType),
    stringCV(productData.batchId),
    uintCV(productData.manufacturingDate),
    stringCV(productData.origin)
  ],
});
```

### Issue Verification Badge
```javascript
const certificateData = {
  productId: "PROD-001",
  certificateType: "organic-certification",
  issuingAuthority: "ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM",
  validUntil: 1672531200
};

await contractCall({
  contractAddress: deployerAddress,
  contractName: "verification-badge-system",
  functionName: "issue-certificate",
  functionArgs: [
    stringCV(certificateData.productId),
    stringCV(certificateData.certificateType),
    principalCV(certificateData.issuingAuthority),
    uintCV(certificateData.validUntil)
  ],
});
```
